[MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome, team. In this unit, you'll learn about MongoDB Atlas. 
We'll learn some of its unique and useful features, and how it hosts and stores your data. 
Then, we'll get started with your very own instance of the Atlas free tier. 
My name is Cam, and I'm a technical instructor here at MongoDB, and I'll be guiding you through this unit. 

Why learn about MongoDB Atlas? Atlas offers a suite of features, tools, 
and services that make it easier for developers to visualize data and build applications. 
With an Atlas account, all the heavy lifting of creating and managing your MongoDB database is handled automatically. 

This includes Native MongoDB features, like high availability and scalability, 
as well as analytics nodes, data visualizations, maintenance, and automatic upgrades with zero downtime. 
In this unit, you'll learn some of the most useful MongoDB Atlas features and services. 

We'll also cover Atlas clusters, and how they store your data. 
You'll create a free Atlas account, deploy a free tier Atlas cluster, 
and use the Atlas Data Explorer to load and view sample data. Let's get started.
