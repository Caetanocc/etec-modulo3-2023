Now you're familiar with Atlas, MongoDB's cloud-based developer data platform. In this unit, you created a free Atlas account and deployed a free tier shared Atlas cluster. You also created your first database user and password. 

Then, you added your IP address to the IP access list, so that you're able to connect to that cluster. Finally, you loaded sample data into the cluster, and viewed documents using a tool called the Data Explorer. 

As a next step, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the sample data in your new cluster. To do so, use the Atlas Data Explorer to query collections and examine documents. Congratulations on getting started with MongoDB Atlas.
